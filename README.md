# Ever-Evolving Portrait
Ever-Evolving Portrait uses p5.js and clmtrackr.js to create a live generative portrait of you. It is to show that we are all ever-evolving beings; although this process cannot be seen and is a constant, this live generative design allows us to be closer to that abstract process just for a moment.
